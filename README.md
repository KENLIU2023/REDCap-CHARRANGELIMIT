# REDCap-CHARRANGELIMIT
This is an External Module for REDCap. 
The official field tag of '@CHARLIMIT' only limits the maximum characters to enter in the text field or note field. The @CHARRANGELIMIT field tag provides a range of the number of characters allowed to enter. For an example:
@CHARRANGELIMIT = "4-6" The field with this tag will be limited to enter 4 to 6 charaters. 
If the minimum equals to the maximum like @CHARRANGELIMIT = '5-5', That means only and at least 5 charaters should be entered.
